## 7.0.0 (2022-05-30)

This version contains **breaking** changes: some errors generated by the new version will no longer group in the Bugnsag dashboard with equivalent errors generated by older versions. This is due to the introduction of a new exception interceptor that gets passed the C# exception objects, rather than having to parse the information from Unity logs.

Please see the [upgrade guide](./UPGRADING.md) for details of all the changes and instructions on how to upgrade.

### Dependency updates

* Update bugsnag-android from v5.22.0 to [v5.22.4](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#5224-2022-05-24)

* Update bugsnag-cocoa from v6.16.1 to [v6.17.1](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#6171-2022-05-18)

## 6.3.2 (2022-05-27)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where leaving a breadcrumb that contained metadata with a null value caused an exception
  [#561](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/561)

## 6.3.1 (2022-04-06)

### Enhancements

* Update bugsnag-android to v5.22.0
  * Added `Bugsnag.isStarted()` to test whether the Bugsnag client is in the middle of initializing. This can be used to guard uses of the Bugsnag API that are either on separate threads early in the app's start-up and so not guaranteed to be executed after `Bugsnag.start` has completed, or where Bugsnag may not have been started at all due to some internal app logic.
    [slack-jallen](https://github.com/slack-jallen):[#1621](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1621)
    [bugsnag-android#1640](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1640)
  * Events and Sessions will be discarded if they cannot be uploaded and are older than 60 days or larger than 1MB
    [bugsnag-android#1633](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1633)
  * Fixed potentially [thread-unsafe access](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/issues/883) when invoking `Bugsnag` static methods across different threads whilst `Bugsnag.start` is still in-flight. It is now safe to call any `Bugsnag` static method once `Bugsnag.start` has _begun_ executing, as access to the client singleton is controlled by a lock, so the new `isStarted` method (see above) should only be required where it cannot be determined whether the call to `Bugsnag.start` has begun or you do not want to wait.
    [bugsnag-android#1638](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1638)
  * Calling `bugsnag_event_set_context` with NULL `context` correctly clears the event context again
    [bugsnag-android#1637](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1637)

### Bug fixes

  [#543](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/543)

* Fixed an issue where breadcrumbs with null messages caused errors
  [#545](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/545)

## 6.3.0 (2022-03-23)

### Enhancements

* Added Android support for [EDM4U](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver). For manual installs there see the new menu item at Window/Bugsnag/Enable EDM Support. For UPM installs we have a [dedicated package](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity-upm-edm4u). [#528](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/528)

* Update bugsnag-android to v5.21.0
  * Fix inconsistencies in stack trace quality for C/C++ events. Resolves a few
    cases where file and line number information was not resolving to the correct
    locations. This change may result in grouping changes to more correctly
    highlight the root cause of an event.
    [#1605](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1605)
    [#1606](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1606)
  * Fixed an issue where an uncaught exception on the main thread could in rare cases trigger an ANR.
    [#1624](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1624)

## 6.2.0 (2022-03-16)

  * Improved the performance and stability of the NDK and ANR plugins by caching JNI references on start
    [bugsnag-android#1596](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/1596)

  * This release adds a compile-time dependency on the Kotlin standard library. This should not affect
  the use of any API supplied by bugsnag-unity.

  * Modularise bugsnag-android into Core, NDK, and ANR artifacts
    [#522](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/522)

    [#623](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/623)

* Update bugsnag-cocoa to v5.23.0:
  * Fix unrecognized selector crash when adding metadata
    [#430](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/430)

  * This release removes support for reporting 'partial' or 'minimal' crash reports
  where the crash report could not be entirely written (due to disk space or other
  issues like the device battery dying). While sometimes the reports could point
  in the right direction for debugging, they could also be confusing or not enough
  information to pursue and close the issue successfully.

    This release  also renames a few configuration properties to align better with the
  intended use and other Bugsnag libraries, so people who use more than one
  platform can easily find related functionality in a different library. The old
  names are deprecated but still supported until the next major release.
  [#435](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/435)

    * `Bugsnag.setBreadcrumbCapacity()` is now `setMaxBreadcrumbs()` on the
    `BugsnagConfiguration` class. In addition, the default number of breadcrumbs
    saved has been raised to 25 and limited to no more than 100.
    * `BugsnagConfiguration.autoNotify` is now named
    `BugsnagConfiguration.autoDetectErrors`
    * `BugsnagConfiguration.autoCaptureSessions` is now named
    `BugsnagConfiguration.autoDetectSessions`

## 4.6.7 (2019-11-19)

  [#178](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/178)

## 4.6.6 (2019-10-22)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed the naming and description of the GUI property "Unique logs per second"
  to be "Unique seconds per log" to reflect the actual behavior, which is the
  number of seconds required between unique Unity log messages which
  bugsnag-unity will convert into breadcrumbs or reports. Increase the value to
  reduce the number of logs or reports generated from frequent error messages.
* Update bugsnag-cocoa to v5.22.9:
  * Deprecate `config.reportBackgroundOOMs` property - designating any app
    termination as a possible error condition can cause a lot of false positives,
    especially since the app can die for many genuine reasons, especially when
    running only in the background.
    [bugsnag-cocoa#425](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/425)
  * Fix use-after-free in `notify()` logic which could lead to a deadlock
    [bugsnag-cocoa#420](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/420)
  * Reduce severity of log message about thread status from 'error' to 'debug' as
    it does not necessarily indicate a problem and is only used for debugging.
    [bugsnag-cocoa#421](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/421)
  * Show correct value for `app.inForeground` when an app launches and crashes in
    the background without ever coming to the foreground.
    [bugsnag-cocoa#415](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/415)
  * Fix improperly retained properties which could result in a crash due to
    premature deallocation
    [bugsnag-cocoa#416](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/416)

## 4.6.5 (2019-09-18)

### Bug fixes

* (Android) Fix behavior of `Configuration.NotifyReleaseStages` to disable
  native C/C++ crash reporting if the current `ReleaseStage` is not in the array
* Fix erroneous automatic session delivery when `NotifyReleaseStages`
  configuration does not include the current `ReleaseStage`
* Fix the behavior of `Configuration.AutoNotify` to disable native crash
  reporting if false
* Update bugsnag-cocoa to v5.22.6:
  * Ensure UIKit APIs are not called from background threads if
    `Bugsnag.start()` is called in the background
    [bugsnag-cocoa#409](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/issues/409)
  * Fix bug in `notifyReleaseStages` where if the release stage of a build was
    changed after `start()`, only the initial value was used to determine whether
    to send a report
    [bugsnag-cocoa#405](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/issues/405)
    [bugsnag-cocoa#412](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/issues/412)
  * Support disabling crash reporting after initialization by setting
    `Bugsnag.configuration.autoNotify`. Previously this value was ignored after
    `Bugsnag.start()` was called, but is now used to update whether crash reports
    will be detected and sent. This interface can be used for crash reporting
    opt-out flows.
    [bugsnag-cocoa#410](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/issues/410)

## 4.6.4 (2019-09-06)

### Enhancements

  ```

  or by unchecking "Auto Notify" when initializing Bugsnag via a GameObject in
  the Unity Inspector.

    normally and is issued a "will terminate" notification, but is terminated
    prior to the out-of-memory watchdog processing the notification
    [bugsnag-cocoa#394](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/394)

* Update bugsnag-cocoa dependency to v5.22.2:
  * Fix trimming the stacktraces of handled error/exceptions using the
    [`depth`](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ios/reporting-handled-exceptions/#depth)
    property.
    [Paul Zabelin](https://github.com/paulz)
    [bugsnag-cocoa#363](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/363)
  * Fix crash report parsing logic around arrays of numbers. Metadata which
    included arrays of numbers could previously had missing values.
    [bugsnag-cocoa#365](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/365)

## 4.5.1 (2019-05-28)

### Bug fixes

* Support automatic session tracking when using code-based initialization flow
  rather than a game object and `BugsnagBehaviour`
* Correctly set the "new session" threshold when using automatic session
  tracking to 30 seconds - no more than 1 session should be automatically
  started every 30 seconds when toggling the app between the foreground and
  background.
* Capture initial session on iOS - previously, the `OnApplicationFocus()`
  callback was relied upon to fire the first session, which does not fire at
  launch on iOS (unlike Android). This change starts the first session in the
  frame following BugsnagUnity initialization.
* Updated bugsnag-cocoa to v5.22.1:
  * Report correct app version in out-of-memory reports. Previously the bundle
    version was reported as the version number rather than the short version
    string.
    [bugsnag-cocoa#349](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/349)
  * Fix missing stacktraces in reports generated from `notify()`
    [bugsnag-cocoa#348](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/348)

## 4.5.0 (2019-05-09)

### Enhancements

* Migrate version information in reports to device.runtimeVersions, adding
  additional info like scripting backend
  [#149](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/149)

* Update bugsnag-android dependency to v4.14.0:
  * Improve In-foreground calculation for report metadata
    [#466](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/466)

  * Migrate version information to device.runtimeVersions
    [#472](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/472)

* Update bugsnag-cocoa dependency to v5.22.0:
  * Migrate version information to device.runtimeVersions
    [#340](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/340)
  * Persist breadcrumbs on disk to allow reading upon next boot in the event of an
    uncatchable app termination.
  * Add `+[Bugsnag appDidCrashLastLaunch]` as a helper to determine if the
    previous launch of the app ended in a crash or otherwise unexpected termination.
  * Report unexpected app terminations on iOS as likely out of memory events where
    the operating system killed the app
  * Add configuration option (`reportOOMs`) to disable out-of-memory (OOM) event
    reporting, defaulting to enabled.
    [#345](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/345)
  * Disable background OOM reporting by default. It can be enabled using
    `reportBackgroundOOMs`.
    [#345](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/345)

### Bug fixes

* Update bugsnag-android dependency to v4.14.0:
  * [NDK] Fix possible null pointer dereference
  * [NDK] Fix possible memory leak if bugsnag-android-ndk fails to successfully
    parse a cached crash report
  * [NDK] Fix possible memory leak when using `bugsnag_leave_breadcrumb()` or
    `bugsnag_notify()`

## 4.4.1 (2019-05-07)

### Bug fixes

* Fix failure to include session info in native reports after stopping/resuming
  a session
* (iOS) Fix session start date formatting
* Support `Notify()` on background threads by caching values from
  `UnityEngine.Application` required for reports during Client initialization
  [#147](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/147)
* Improve the number of stacktrace frames gathered on Unity 2017.x by
  subscribing to the `logMessageReceived` callback in addition to
  `logMessageReceivedThreaded` and filtering by thread to remove duplicates. The
  main thread-only `logMessageReceived` callback receives more stackframes on
  some versions of Unity 2017, improving the debugging experience.


## 4.4.0 (2019-04-05)

### Enhancements

* Update bugsnag-android dependency to v4.13.0:
  * Add ANR detection to bugsnag-android (ANR detection is disabled on Unity)
    [bugsnag-android#442](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/442)

  * Add unhandled_events field to native payload
    [bugsnag-android#445](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/445)

  * Add stopSession() and resumeSession() to Client
    [bugsnag-android#429](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/429)

### Bug fixes

* Update bugsnag-android dependency to v4.13.0:
  * Prevent overwriting config.projectPackages if already set
    [bugsnag-android#428](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/428)

  * Fix incorrect session handledCount when notifying in quick succession
    [bugsnag-android#434](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/434)

  * Ensure boolean object from map serialised as boolean primitive in JNI
    [bugsnag-android#452](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/452)

  * Prevent NPE occurring when calling resumeSession()
    [bugsnag-android#444](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/444)

* Update bugsnag-cocoa dependency to v5.19.1:
  * Fix generating an incorrect stacktrace used when logging an exception to
    Bugsnag from a location other than the original call site (for example, from a
    logging function or across threads).  If an exception was raised/thrown, then
    the resulting Bugsnag report from `notify()` will now use the `NSException`
    instance's call stack addresses to construct the stacktrace, ignoring depth.
    This fixes an issue in macOS exception reporting where `reportException` is
    reporting the handler code stacktrace rather than the reported exception
    stack.
    [bugsnag-cocoa#334](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/334)

  * Fix network connectivity monitor by connecting to the correct domain
    [Jacky Wijaya](https://github.com/Jekiwijaya)
    [bugsnag-cocoa#332](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/332)

## 4.3.0 (2019-03-14)

This release is the first to distribute Unity packages with and without 64-bit
ABI libraries for Android. In most cases, `Bugsnag.unitypackage` is the correct
package to use, as by default most Unity Android apps only can use 32-bit
binaries.

### Enhancements

* Add StopSession() and ResumeSession() to public API
  [#136](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/136)

* Update bugsnag-android dependency to v4.11.0:
  * Add stopSession() and resumeSession() to Client
    [bugsnag-android#429](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/429)
  * Prevent overwriting config.projectPackages if already set
    [bugsnag-android#428](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/428)
  * Fix incorrect session handledCount when notifying in quick succession
    [bugsnag-android#434](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/434)

* Update bugsnag-cocoa dependency to v5.19.0:
  * Add stopSession() and resumeSession() to Bugsnag
    [bugsnag-cocoa#325](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/325)
  * Capture basic report diagnostics in the file path in case of crash report
    content corruption
    [bugsnag-cocoa#327](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/327)

### Bug fixes

* Ensure session and user information is included in native crash reports
  [#138](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/138)
  [bugsnag-cocoa#333](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/333)
  [bugsnag-android#439](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/439)

* [Android] Remove references to 64-bit ABIs included in the package
  [#139](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/139)

* Make `ErrorClass` and `ErrorMessage` mutable on `Exception`. This allows for
  modifying both properties from callbacks:

  ```cs
  Bugsnag.Notify(exception, report => {
    report.Exceptions[0].ErrorClass = "CustomException";
    report.Exceptions[0].ErrorMessage = "something notable";
  });
  ```
  [#140](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/140)

* Set severity reason when manually specifying severity as a parameter to
  `Notify()`. This sets the correct reason for the severity selection on the
  dashboard.
  [#140](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/140)

## 4.2.2 (2019-02-26)

### Bug fixes

  breadcrumbs (>500 key/value pairs) are attached at once, or if `Notify()` is
  called concurrently several times.
  [#132](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/132)

## 4.2.1 (2019-02-21)

### Bug fixes

* Ensure a stacktrace is attached to reports without underlying exceptions, such
  as log messages using an 'error' or 'warning' level

  [#126](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/126)

## 4.1.2 (2019-01-22)

### Bug fixes

Update bugsnag-android dependency to v4.11.0:
* Fix cached error deserialisation where the Throwable has a cause
  [#418](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/418)
* Refactor error report deserialisation
  [#419](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/pull/419)
* Fix unlikely initialization failure if a device orientation event listener
  cannot be enabled

  * bugsnag-cocoa v5.17.3
  * bugsnag-android v4.10.0

### Enhancements

* Add a configuration option for allowing Unity exceptions to reduce a project's
  stability score. [See the documentation for
  `ReportUncaughtExceptionsAsHandled`](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/unity/configuration-options/#ReportUncaughtExceptionsAsHandled)

### Bug fixes

* Fix exception parsing for Android Java exceptions to ensure correct grouping,
  "handled"-ness, and remove extraneous stack frame from the top of the
  backtrace.
* Fix off-by-one error in event counts in the session tracking implementation

## 4.0.0 (2018-11-19)

This is a new major release with many features and fixes. See the [upgrade
guide](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/blob/master/UPGRADING.md) for
more information on how to update your integration, or the [integration
guide](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/unity/) to get started.

### Enhancements

* Unity/C# errors are now automatically detected and reported on Windows and any
  other Unity platform (not including native crashes)
* Exceptions logged on background threads via the [Unity `Debug.Log` API]() are
  now automatically detected and reported in additional to exceptions detected
  on the main thread.
* Support for [session and stability tracking](https://docs.bugsnag.com/product/releases/releases-dashboard/#stability-score)
* Support for [logging detailed breadcrumbs](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/unity/#logging-breadcrumbs)

## 3.6.7 (2018-09-21)

### Improvements

* Automatically detect app version from Unity environment for WebGL
  | [#94](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/94)
* Report app information in WebGL: `duration`, `inForeground` and `durationInForeground`
  | [#94](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/pull/94)

**Note:**
During the preparation for this release we noticed a workflow issue when targeting tvOS. In order to successfully build for tvOS, after importing the Bugsnag plugin there is a manual step required:

- In the Unity editor, go to Project > Assets > iOS > Bugsnag
- Select all source files in this directory
- In the inspector pane check `tvOS` in the "Include platforms" list
- Click the "Apply" button at the bottom of the inspector pane

We'll work on making this install process smoother in the future.
