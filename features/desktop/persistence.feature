    Scenario: Receive a persisted session mac and windows
        When I run the game in the "PersistSession" state
        And I wait for 5 seconds
        And I run the game in the "PersistSessionReport" state
        And I wait to receive 2 sessions
        Then the session is valid for the session reporting API version "1.0" for the "Unity Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
        And the session payload field "app.releaseStage" equals the platform-dependent string:
            | macos | Second Session |
            | windows | First Session |
        And I discard the oldest session
        And the session payload field "app.releaseStage" equals the platform-dependent string:
            | macos | First Session |
            | windows | Second Session |
        And I run the game in the "ClearBugsnagCache" state
        And I wait for 5 seconds
