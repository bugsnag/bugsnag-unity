Feature: Reporting unhandled events

    Scenario: Reporting an uncaught exception
        When I run the game in the "UncaughtException" state
        And I wait to receive an error

        And the event "unhandled" is false
        And custom metadata is included in the event
        And the first significant stack frame methods and files should match:
