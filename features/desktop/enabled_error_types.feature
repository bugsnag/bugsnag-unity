Feature: Enabled Error Types

    Scenario: Disable All Error Types
        When I run the game in the "DisableAllErrorTypes" state
        And I wait to receive an error
        Then the error is valid for the error reporting API sent by the Unity notifier
        And I discard the oldest error
        Then I should receive no requests


    Scenario: Only Enable Log Logs
        When I run the game in the "EnableLogLogs" state
        And I wait to receive an error
        Then the error is valid for the error reporting API sent by the Unity notifier
        And I discard the oldest error
        Then I should receive no requests


 Scenario: Only Enable Unhandled Exceptions
        When I run the game in the "EnableUnhandledExceptions" state
        And I wait to receive an error
        Then the error is valid for the error reporting API sent by the Unity notifier
        And I discard the oldest error
        Then I should receive no requests
