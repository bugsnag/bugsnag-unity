Feature: Android NDK crash

  Background:
    Given I clear the Bugsnag cache

    #NOTE: Metadata testing will be improved in this scenario after PLAT-9127

  Scenario: NDK Signal raised
    When I run the game in the "AndroidNDKSignal" state
    And I wait for 3 seconds
    And I clear any error dialogue
    And On Mobile I relaunch the app
    And I run the game in the "StartSDKDefault" state
        # Intentionally adding long wait times here - a core component of this
        # feature is ensuring that only a SINGLE event is sent. Unity includes
        # a handler for NDK events which are delivered immediately and should
        # be intentionally ignored and the event discarded, since the same
        # event has already been captured and will be sent next launch
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    Then I wait to receive 1 error

        # Exception details
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGSEGV"
    And the exception "message" equals "Segmentation violation (invalid memory reference)"
    And the exception "type" equals "c"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGSEGV"
    And the event "severityReason.unhandledOverridden" is false
    And custom metadata is included in the event
    And expected app metadata is included in the event
        # Stacktrace validation
    And the error payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.stacktrace" is a non-empty array
    And the event "exceptions.0.stacktrace.0.method" is not null
    And the error payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.stacktrace.0.frameAddress" starts with "0x"

        #breadcrumbs
    And the event "breadcrumbs.0.name" equals "Bugsnag loaded"
    And the event "breadcrumbs.1.name" equals "test"

        # User
    And the event "user.id" is not null

        # Native context override
    And the event "context" equals "My Context"
