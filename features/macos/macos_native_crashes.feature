  Scenario: Reporting a MacOS native crash
    When I run the game in the "MacOSNativeCrash" state
    And I wait for 2 seconds

      | __pthread_kill       |
      | abort                |
      | crashy_signal_runner |
    And the error payload field "notifier.name" equals "Unity Bugsnag Notifier"
    And expected device metadata is included in the event
    And custom metadata is included in the event
    And feature flags are included in the event
    And the event "breadcrumbs.0.name" equals "Bugsnag loaded"
