Feature: Handled Errors and Exceptions

    Scenario: Reporting a handled exception
        When I run the game in the "Notify" state
        Then I should receive a request
        And the request is a valid for the error reporting API

        And the exception "errorClass" equals "Exception"
        And the exception "message" equals "blorb"
        And the event "unhandled" is false
        And the first significant stack frame methods and files should match:
            | Main.DoNotify()      |
