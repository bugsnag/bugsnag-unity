# bugsnag-unity-web-request

This is a wrapper for the Unity [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) class.

It allows the BugSnag Unity Performance SDK and the BugSnag Unity Notifier to be notified of the start and end points of a UnityWebRequest.

To use, simply use the class BugsnagUnityWebRequest in your project exactly the same way you would use UnityWebRequest.
