# Bugsnag exception reporter for Unity
[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-latest-blue.svg)](http://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/unity/)

The Bugsnag Notifier for Unity gives you instant notification of exceptions
thrown from your Unity games on iOS and Android devices, as well as standalone
Mac and WebGL deployments. Exceptions in your Unity code (JS, C# and Boo) as
well as native crashes (Objective C, Java) are automatically detected and sent to Bugsnag.

[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web
and mobile apps, helping you to understand and resolve them as fast as possible.
